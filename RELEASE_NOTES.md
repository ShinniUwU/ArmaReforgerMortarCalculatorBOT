#### 📝 A Note on Transparency
We believe in being transparent with our users. As you explore the code, you may find certain features or UI elements that are commented out. This is a deliberate decision to keep some functionality private for the time being, while still acknowledging its existence. We are committed to providing a powerful and user-friendly tool, and this approach allows us to focus on delivering a stable and polished experience.
